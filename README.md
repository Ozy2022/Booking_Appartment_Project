# Booking_Appartment_Project_Paython

The program consists of four options: reservation, check-out, printing all the information for
the tenant and exit from the program. In case of the first option, the tenant can choose the
type of apartment he wants. Furthermore, the program will print out whether that type of
apartment is available or not for the tenant. Continuing onto the second option the tenant can
check out of the apartment by entering his name only and making sure all of the payment is
being made and the third option the tenant can print all the information such as his personal
data or the date of his entry and exit from the apartment and finally the exit option from the
program.
